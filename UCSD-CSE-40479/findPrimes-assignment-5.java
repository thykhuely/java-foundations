/*
 * FindPrimes.java
 * a) Write a method that determines whether a number is prime.
 * 
 * b) Use this method in an application that determines and 
 * displays all the prime numbers less than 10,000. 
 * How many numbers up to 10,000 do you have to test to ensure that youâ€™ve found all the primes?
 * 
 * c) Initially, you might think that n/2 is the upper limit for which you must test to see
 * whether a number n is prime, but you need only go as high as the square root of n. 
 * Re- write the program, and run it both ways.
